        <p class="item-1">One of London's most iconic landmarks and architectural marvels, the Tower Bridge is a bascule and suspension bridge located above and across the River Thames. It is noted for its unmatched Victorian or Neo-Gothic style of architecture and has two towers connected by two walkways. It was constructed in the late 1800s for better access to the East End of London. Often confused with the London Bridge, the Tower Bridge is considered to be way more superior and majestic, visually. The bridge gets its name from the Tower of London, situated nearby</p>

        <h2 id="text-2">Ninfa Garden</h2>
    </div>
        <p class="item-2">The name Ninfa (Nymph) derives from a temple of the Roman era, dedicated to the Naiad Nymphs goddesses of spring water, which is still located in the garden. The city of Ninfa was destroyed in the fourteenth century; since the sixteenth century, several members of the Caetani family present in the Pontine and Lepine territory for many centuries, decided to create a garden with precious botanical varieties, pools of water and fountains. However, it was only in the nineteenth century that Ada Bootle Wilbraham, the wife of Onoraro Caetani, and her sons built an actual Anglo-Saxon style garden, by draining the swamps, planting cypress trees, oaks, beeches, and restoring some ruins, including the baronial palace. The care of the garden was continued by the descendants of the Caetani family, until the last heir, Lelia, who added various botanical species and established the Roffredo Caetani Foundation, which still deals with protecting the Giardino di Ninfa and the castle of Sermoneta. There are 1300 botanical species over the eight acres of landscape. You can admire nineteen varieties of deciduous magnolia, birch, water iris and several Japanese maples</p>

        The Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world and a global icon. Truly a feat of engineering, the building represents the conceptual heart and soul of the city of Dubai.
        
        At 828m tall, this magnificent structure is located next to The Dubai Mall and has drawn visitors from all over the world since opening in 2010. The unmatched Burj Khalifa view can be taken in from not one but two observations decks – the two-storey At the Top on the 124th and 125th floors, as well as one of the world’s highest observation decks (555m) on the 148th floor. For a truly special time, visitors can choose to dine in the restaurant and lounge At.mosphere on the 122nd floor, or experience new heights at The Lounge, Burj Khalifa, which is spread across floors 152, 153 and 154, making it the tallest lounge on the planet.</p>

     <h2 id="text-4"> Museo Egizio</h2>
    </div>
     <p class="item-4">The Museo Egizio – founded in 1824 – is the oldest museum dedicated to Egyptian antiquities and represents the second most important collection, outside of Egypt, of art and artifacts from this fascinating civilization who developed on the banks of the Nile. In its almost 200 years of history, the Museum has repeatedly been transformed, renewed and rethought, in an attempt to conjugate the needs of the scientific research with the ones of the visitors. The permanent exhibition presents the history of the Museum and its collections, the archaeological contexts of the objects on display, as well as the stories behind the expeditions, their organization and their discoveries.
        The exhibition space consists of around 10.000 square meters and 15 rooms filled with 3300 artifacts distributed on 5 floors, as well as a 600-square-meter area dedicated to temporary exhibitions.</p>
